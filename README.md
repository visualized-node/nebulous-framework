# The Project is no longer maintained. May release some patches at one point. If you want to create addons for usg join our Discord Server, and check the addon-sources channel!

**Nebulous** is an open-sourced UI Library specifically developed for creating ui faster in my game and in mods along with implementing Attirbute-Based events and applications (transitioned disabling for example) etc. It's also peak customizable so one point for that.

## This is obviously still a WIP and most things are written in an unclean and unoptimized matter. Do not judge this stage of development as a final product

# 1. Usage

### Requirements

- Roblox Studio (pretty obvious)
- Rojo (Version up to date or later than 7.2.1)
- Patience
- Some basic knowledge to require the module and use it

### Installing

- **Release Method**

If Releases are available, download the latest Release.rbxl file around, drag it into Roblox studio and place it either in **ReplicatedStorage** or in your main client script.

- **Source Code Method (Harder)**

If there are no Releases available, download the .zip source code or clone the repository, extract the zip or open the cloned repository and voila you have the source code of Nebulous at your hands!

First of all you wanna make sure you meet all the requirements, mainly the Rojo one since you're not gonna be to port all the source code to Roblox Studio as fast and you're gonna have to copy paste every single script and place it where it's supposed to manually. Once you checked that basically just open a rojo server, connect it to studio and you're done. You can find more tutorials at Rojo's official site.

I wrote this readme  with my eyes half closed so don't expect to understand much lol. gonna update it anyways
